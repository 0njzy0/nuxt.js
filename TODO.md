Tasks for `0.9.10`:
- [x] `build.publicPath` #25
- [ ] Use [name].[chunkhash].js for generated js (production) #218
- [ ] Add expired headers (production)
- [x] Activate layout only on afterEach #214
- [ ] Custom layout in layouts/error.vue #172

-> Not possible to have custom layout for a page, it should do the condition inside the layout itself (because of the middleware strategy)
